#Technical Requirements
The replication files require Stata software (version 17) to run.
 
#Instructions
1. To replicate the analysis, you need to obtain the dataset (Pairfam, v13.0; doi: https://doi.org/10.4232/pairfam.5678.13.0.0) through GESIS (https://search.gesis.org/research_data/ZA5678).
2. In the analyses.do file, you can find the complete code to replicate the analysis. At the beginning of the .do file (global inpath `"" /file path ""') replace the part  '/file path'  with the path to the directory where you have downloaded the data. After replacing the directory path, you can execute the file.
